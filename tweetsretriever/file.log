The original Star Wars trilogy is easily the greatest movie trilogy of all time

@creampuffsteph can't you go see star wars while they see the shitty movie? Group decision be damned? 

Sorry, party update 5: my parents just bragged how they basically fell asleep during the new Star Wars movie -_- 

Star Wars was actually the best movie ever 

I saw the movie Star Wars <img class="Emoji Emoji--forText" src="https://abs.twimg.com/emoji/v2/72x72/1f640.png" draggable="false" alt="üôÄ" title="Mattes Katzengesicht" aria-label="Emoji: Mattes Katzengesicht"> 

Waited to see Star Wars because I didn't want to sit in crowded theater w/ people who cheer & clap during the movie. They still did. 

Sooo...fuck that new star wars movie 

These people next to us in the movie theater kept talking. And talking. And talking. And it was in Star Wars. FML 

I just read that Tatiana Maslany and Gina Rodriguez might be in the new Star Wars movie and I'm all in. I'd pay good money to see them in it 

Star Wars The Force Awakens - MOVIE REVIEW !!! http://youtu.be/9MT8JdrDr34?a 

I need to see the new Star Wars movie before I have had every tiniest detail of the film described to me by everyone I know. :/ 

gbhattarai: This holiday season has been family movie time, watched Star Wars, Jurassic World, and Bazirao Mastani (Bollywood) in two days. 

Watched my first star wars movie and now I'm about to have lobster for the first time #dayoffirst 

@TheFansPodcast The best Star Wars movie. 

Jake and I are discussing the new Star Wars movie and we've never texted back so rapidly and consistently 

@LaurenCimorelli I've only seen one Star Wars movie when I was 7 years old and I haven't wanted to watch it since. 

@LaurenCimorelli I've never seen a Star Wars movie

Star Wars Was The Greatest Movie Man I Swear

Star wars 7 was total shit. I'm curious about why did everyone praise the movie like it was a masterpiece, it's not. 

there's a tornado literally 4 minutes from my house but don't worry my family is watching another Star Wars movie 

I've honestly never watched any Harry Potter or Star Wars movie all the way through 

For the past month, I've been watching Donnie Yen movies. Recently I heard he is to be in a Star Wars movie. Imagine him with a light saber. 

STAR WARS WAS THE BESTT MOVIE

Tried to give youngest Star Wars education but on Amazon Prime for $20 per movie. Just let him figure it out for himself. Good movie. 

I legit just said to someone I've never seen a Star Wars movie I'm watching them now and he just said "yoda dies" I want to cry so much 

So, Guido is going to see the new Star Wars movie with Mr 7. Can't believe it. Is their any scenes with wogs in it? #nerdseverywhere

If you've seen the new Star Wars movie already I kinda hate you 

@marsrader No--because there is no Star Wars. It's a fucking MOVIE, Fanboy!!!

@eliasisquith would love to see somebody tear down a Pixar movie like they do Star Wars. Both kids movies lmao 

@leboism Star Wars should not feel like a Michael Bay movie 

Just saw #StarWarsForceAwakens this week and it's the best star wars movie ever.

@burgeroise no other combination of words has ever made me as horny to watch a Star Wars movie 

Just because Star Wars Ep 7 wasn't a let down, doesn't make it the BEST Star War movie. It is a great movie and better than the prequels 

My internal monologue for basically that entire movie was AHHHHHH! STAR WARS!!! AHHHHHH! 

Movie day items: Star Wars trilogy; brownies I've thoroughly taste tested; one of the five kilos of cherries mum gave me at Christmas; wine 

Dad: Is Yoda in the new Star Wars movie 

@MattVereen Continuing my snapchat Star Wars scale I give the Force Awakens a 9/10 and have it as the 3rd best movie behind 2. IV and 1. V 

OH MY FREAKIN GOSH!!! Star Wars was AMAZING!! I can't wait for the next one!! Literally dying the whole movie #StarWarsTheForceAwakens 

Gostei de um v√≠deo http://youtu.be/9hzd_K5QdXQ?aStar Wars: The Force Awakens Official Comic-Con 2015 Reel (2015) - Star Wars Movie 

Had pats and saw the Star Wars movie the only thing keeping this day from being perfect is if the Eagles lose please don't ruin this day.. 

I went to see Star Wars, today, I'm so glad the commercials beforehand showed scenes from the movie, that's what I really want from them. 

That new Star Wars movie was hella good man props for keeping it new and modern but still classic as can be 

Yes, you can make the case that EP 7 was A New Hope 2.0 but this is fine since there hasn't been a Star Wars movie since 1983 

@MJRUNSHIT23 yo purrp help me spoil this gay star wars wars movie and rt my spoilers, i only got banned by every gay rapper cuz of u 

@AZZATRU Star Wars won't end like ever. Too timeless, too much potential. You can name a movie "Star Wars" that's unrecognizable to TFA 

So thank to @NorthernlionLP , I just watched my FIRST Star Wars movie. He wanted Episode 1 to be the first and man, it sucks real bad. 

My mom bought front row seats for star wars tonight nO I CANNOT WATCH THAT MOVIE FROM THERE WHY IS SHE SO UNINTELLIGENT

Nerd alert: prepping Mom for the new Star Wars movie. <span class="twitter-hashflag-container">https://www.instagram.com/p/_xUnpRHWdx/ 

There's no way people can say that there is a better movie series than Star Wars. 

@B0bduh Even in a supposedly SJW-centric movie like Star Wars, the "little white cuck ball" is making all the money 

Spoiler for Star Wars: the butler did it :-) ps more snow in movie than in Montreal for now 

@robertmclaws I feel like this movie is getting a pass cause of Star Wars and the promise of seqeuel 

I'm going to watch my first Star Wars movie in its entirety now 

The Return of the Jedi was the first bad Star Wars movie. No one in that film has a real role except for Vader. 

How can you call this a Star Wars movie, there is virtually NO podracing 

Just saw Star Wars. Don't understand the acclaim. Mediocre movie at best. 

‚ÄúStar Wars: The Force Awakens‚Äù is set to be the fastest movie to $1 billion in sales http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-26/-star-wars-poised-to-set-mark-for-fastest-film-to-1-billion https://pic.twitter.com/VCGsNx8jK9 

@TheAtlantic @molcher This article doesn't make sense. No-one is ever going to play a Guatemalan in a Star Wars movie. 

@NerdGerhl @markpopham I have never cared for the plot in a Star Wars movie so the ANH story beats didn't bug me. 

Seeing the Star Wars movie for a second time just so I can see the Warcraft trailer again. 

Basically, I don't even understand it when someone says "the movie is flawed". I'm too afraid to google "star wars flaws." 

Does anyone else want a new episode of HIMYM so we can hear what Tod and Marshall think of the new Star Wars movie? Just me?

The fact that non-star wars fans have seen the latest movie and I freaking haven't because I can't freaking leave my house makes me so sad 

Just got out of the movie house but I'm still up for another round! Star Wars was awesome! I‚Ä¶ https://www.instagram.com/p/_waIBWxrUR/

@TWTdip I look like every crook in every Star Wars movie 

that star wars movie hit me fight in the fucking feels man 

opinion re: new Star Wars movie: amazing. reminds me of being a kid. back when main cultural Western export wasn't its own hilarious demise 

@neek_alexander @dtiaun_34 Star Wars will not be the movie I'm seeing <img class="Emoji Emoji--forText" src="https://abs.twimg.com/emoji/v2/72x72/1f602.png" draggable="false" alt="üòÇ" title="Face with tears of joy" aria-label="Emoji: Face with tears of joy"> 

i liked star wars more this time prob cuz of my mom laughing and freakin out the whole movie 

How Star Wars ended: me, my parents and my sister yelling at each other about the movie while the credits rolled. 

I'm one of only about 6 other people in this movie theater to see Star Wars. Perfect. 

star wars seemed content to be a total nostalgia-fest. creed felt like a movie that didn't want to live in its series' shadow 

Close call there, guys. (JJ Abrams putting Greg Grunberg in the Star Wars movie lest the fans revolt) 

Star Wars movie ends and my mom says "well at least the octopus things were cool." My moms always so optimistic.
